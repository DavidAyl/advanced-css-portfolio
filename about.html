        Hello, thank you for visiting my website, my name is David Aylward and I
        am a student studying web development. I have an experienced background
        in computer repair and troubleshooting. I have been certified in many
        different things such as Adobe, Excel, Access, and I even have
        certifications with Apple. I started in web development with free code
        camps and
        <a id="ude" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> bootcamps, I quickly
        decided this is something that I want to spend my time doing, I feel it
        gives you a lot of room to express creativity. I believe a lot of time
        and effort goes into a webpage so I always try to take my time and make
        sure I get everything exactly how I want it. I have always taken a lot
        of pride in my work so I will always try to make my work the best I can.
