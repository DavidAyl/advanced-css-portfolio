      Services offered by me are all made to order and never made using
      templates or older designs. We will take the journey together to make sure
      you are satisfied with the way your site works. I will be in contact with
      you and giving you updates every step of the way. Each webpage will come
      with an interactive UI and will adjust accordingly to the pages size.

    <p>
      Html is a markup language that lays the structure of your page. When you
      choose me to create your website you get in depth and truly meaningful
      content. This will be one of the most collaborative parts of the design of
      your webpage. In this section we will put anything from navigation bars,
      to hyperlinks and even photos, all of this will get styled later.
    </p>

  <h2 class="sbhd">CSS</h2>
  <section class="svc">
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS will be the visual design of your
      website, this will include colors, spacing and even background images.
      This will be the page I will focus on the most as it catches the most
      eyes. I believe the key to a good website is something simple and easy to
      comprehend. We will choose a color palette, logos, and other stylistic
    choices to stick to as a foundation.

  <h2 class="sbhd"> JavaScript</h2>
  <section class="svc">
    <p>
      Javascript is the main language that is going to make your webpage
      functional and interactive. Through the use of CSS we will be able to
      create forms to collect clients data, image animations, music and more.
      Javascript is something that can really make or break your page, if it
      lacks being interactive, users may be inclined to leaving sooner.
