## About

This website is about me as a web developer. This page is my portfolio which I will show to future employers and/or clients. This page is good to show off my knowledge of the languages as well as show off other projects.

<hr>

## Usage

The usage of this page is to have a better chance at making a successful career out of web development. When applying to jobs or trying to land clients in the freelancing world, this would be the page that I show them. I also have a form at the bottom to collect potential client contact information for free leads.
